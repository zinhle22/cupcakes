    <p>A cupcake is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin or aluminum cup</p>
    <p>One of the reasons we're so in love with cupcakes is the prettiness factor<p>
      <p>It seems there are more beautiful designs for them every day<p>
        <p>It's hard to resist a dessert that's pretty and delicious<p>
          <p>The fact that cupcakes are beautifully decorated is one reason we love them<p>
